## Requirements:
 
 1. Record exercises performed (similar to how they may be recorded in a workout journal, with sets, reps, weight used, and other potential attributes).
 2. Select from predefined common exercises.
 3. Input custom exercises.
 4. Create a workout routine from defined or custom exercises.
 5. Allow the user to queued up a routine so that during a workout you only need to press a single button to record the set and move to the next.
 6. Optional: Provide a cool down timer when a set is marked as completed.
 7. Allow the user to create a schedule of routines, and the app should keep track of what day of the schedule the user is on.
    The schedule can be day specific or simply a cycle with no tie to any specific day or day interval.
 8. Provide quick access statistical analysis based on the total body of exercise information recorded.
 9. Provide quick access to metrics and milestones based on the total body of exercise information reported. (E.g. total reps performed for a given exercise, total weight moved, maximum weight moved)
 10. User data must be privately stored.
 11. Utilize advertisements to monetize the application.
 12. Allow user to purchase the app to remove advertisements.
 13. Allow paid users to back up their data to the cloud.
 14. Allow paid users to synchronize multiple devices to the cloud.
